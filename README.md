# Tutorial: Multi-Stakeholder Recommender Systems

Intro: Recommender systems are able to produce a list of recommended items tailored to user preferences, while the end user is the only stakeholder in the system. However, there could be multiple stakeholders in several applications or domains, e.g., e-commerce, advertising, educations, dating, job seeking, and so forth. It is useful to produce the recommendations by balancing the needs of different stakeholders. This tutorial covers the introductions to multi-stakeholder recommender systems (MSRS), introduces multiple case studies, discusses the corresponding methods and challenges to develop MSRS. Particularly, a demo based on the MOEA framework will be given in the talk.

Demo: We release a demo by using an educational case study. We are building a general library now, but currently the demo just shows case by using the educational data. 

Slide: The slide will be released on this page
